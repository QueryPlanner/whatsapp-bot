## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Automated Server Setup:** Introduced `setup.sh` to automate system updates, Docker installation, firewall (UFW) configuration, and Fail2Ban setup.
- **Production Deployment Workflow:** Enhanced GitHub Actions (`docker-publish.yml`) to securely inject environment variables (DB credentials, API keys) into the production server.
- **Configurable Connection Pooling:** Exposed PostgreSQL connection pool settings (`DB_POOL_SIZE`, `DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`, etc.) via environment variables.
- **Observability Configuration:** Added support for configuring `ROOT_AGENT_MODEL` and Langfuse keys (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, etc.) via deployment secrets.
- **Testing Standards:** Added `AGENTS.md` with strict guidelines for AI assistants, enforcing real-code testing over mocking internal logic.
- **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` with comprehensive deployment guides.

### Changed
- Refactored `agent.py` to dynamically load `LiteLlm` for OpenRouter models.
- Standardized CI checks (`ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`) to run before every build.

### Fixed
- Resolved `ValueError: Missing key inputs argument` by ensuring API keys are properly injected into the container environment.
- Addressed interactive prompt issues in `setup.sh` by setting `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`.
